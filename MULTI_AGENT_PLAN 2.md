## Current Sprint Tasks

<!-- Agents update this section with their current work -->

### In Progress

- None

### Pending

- [AWS Architect] Design AppSync-only architecture migration
- [Marketplace Builder] Implement provider onboarding flow improvements
- [Quality Guardian] Create comprehensive test suite for resilience layer
- [Security Sentinel] Audit and harden authentication flows
- [Performance Optimizer] Analyze and optimize Lambda cold starts

### Completed

- Initial agent system setup

## Communication Protocol

### 1. Task Assignment

Tasks are assigned based on agent expertise:

- Infrastructure changes → AWS Architect
- Feature development → Marketplace Builder
- Test creation/validation → Quality Guardian
- Security reviews → Security Sentinel
- Performance issues → Performance Optimizer

### 2. Handoff Protocol

```xml
<handoff>
  <from>AgentName</from>
  <to>AgentName</to>
  <task_id>TASK-XXX</task_id>
  <context>What was done and what needs attention</context>
  <artifacts>List of files/resources created</artifacts>
</handoff>
```

### 3. Status Updates

All agents must update status using:

```xml
<status_update>
  <agent>AgentName</agent>
  <task_id>TASK-XXX</task_id>
  <status>pending|in_progress|blocked|completed</status>
  <notes>Additional context</notes>
</status_update>
```

### 4. Critical Alerts

For urgent issues requiring immediate attention:

```xml
<critical_alert>
  <severity>critical|high</severity>
  <issue>Description of the issue</issue>
  <impact>Systems/features affected</impact>
  <required_agents>List of agents needed</required_agents>
</critical_alert>
```

## Orchestration Rules

1. **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks with dependencies must wait for prerequisite completion
2. **Parallel Execution**: Independent tasks can run simultaneously across agents
3. **Review Gates**: Security and Quality agents have veto power on deployments
4. **Escalation Path**: Blocked tasks escalate to human review after 24 hours
5. **Documentation**: All agents must document decisions in their work artifacts

## Agent Collaboration Matrix

| From/To                   | AWS Architect         | Marketplace Builder  | Quality Guardian    | Security Sentinel     | Performance Optimizer |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| **AWS Architect**         | -                     | Infrastructure specs | Test requirements   | Security requirements | Performance targets   |
| **Marketplace Builder**   | Infrastructure needs  | -                    | Code for testing    | Security review       | Performance metrics   |
| **Quality Guardian**      | Test results          | Bug reports          | -                   | Security findings     | Performance issues    |
| **Security Sentinel**     | Security requirements | Vulnerability fixes  | Security test needs | -                     | Security overhead     |
| **Performance Optimizer** | Scaling needs         | Performance fixes    | Performance tests   | Security impact       | -                     |

## Success Metrics

- **Task Completion Rate**: > 95% within SLA
- **Handoff Efficiency**: < 30 minutes average handoff time
- **Quality Gate Pass Rate**: > 90% first-time pass
- **Security Issues Prevented**: 100% critical issues caught before production
- **Performance Targets Met**: 100% of defined SLAs achieved

## Emergency Procedures

### System Down

1. Security Sentinel assesses for security breach
2. AWS Architect identifies infrastructure issues
3. Marketplace Builder implements hotfix if needed
4. Quality Guardian validates fix
5. Performance Optimizer confirms system stability

### Security Incident

1. Security Sentinel leads response
2. All agents pause non-critical work
3. AWS Architect isolates affected resources
4. Marketplace Builder patches vulnerabilities
5. Quality Guardian validates security fixes

### Performance Degradation

1. Performance Optimizer leads investigation
2. AWS Architect reviews infrastructure metrics
3. Marketplace Builder identifies code issues
4. Quality Guardian runs performance tests
5. Security Sentinel ensures fixes don't introduce vulnerabilities
