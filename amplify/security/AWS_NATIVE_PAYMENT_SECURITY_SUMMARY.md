- MFA required for all payment system access
- Hardware token support for high-privilege operations
- Session duration limits and monitoring

**Role Separation:**
- Dedicated service roles for each Lambda function
- Cross-service access restrictions
- Emergency break-glass procedures

### 3. Audit Logging and Monitoring (`/amplify/security/logging/`)

**Comprehensive Audit Trails:**
- 10-year retention for financial compliance
- Tamper-evident log storage with digital signatures
- Real-time security event detection
- Automated compliance reporting

**Security Monitoring:**
- CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities
- Real-time fraud detection alerts
- Automated incident response workflows
- Security Operations Center integration

### 4. Fraud Detection (`/amplify/security/fraud-detection/`)

**Machine Learning Models:**
- AWS Fraud Detector integration
- Real-time transaction risk scoring
- Behavioral analytics and anomaly detection
- Geographic and device-based risk assessment

**Rule-Based Detection:**
- Velocity-based fraud prevention
- Account takeover protection
- Synthetic identity detection
- Business rule engine for custom fraud rules
