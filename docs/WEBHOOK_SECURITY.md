## Detailed Technical Analysis

### 1. Webhook Route Security (/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts)

**Strengths:**
- Implements Stripe webhook signature verification using `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()`
- Proper error handling for missing signature headers
- Uses environment variables for webhook secrets

**Critical Issues:**
- CORS configuration allows unrestricted cross-origin access (`'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'`)
- Generic error responses may expose system information
- No rate limiting or request size validation
- Missing input validation beyond signature verification

### 2. Webhook Deduplication Service (/amplify/data/webhook-deduplication.ts)

**Strengths:**
- Atomic operations using DynamoDB conditional writes
- Comprehensive retry logic and stale lock detection
- TTL-based automatic cleanup
- Built-in Stripe signature validation

**Areas for Improvement:**
- 5-minute signature tolerance window is excessive (industry standard: 3 minutes)
- Race condition handling could be more robust
- Missing metrics and monitoring integration

### 3. Webhook Authorizer Lambda (/amplify/functions/webhook-authorizer/handler.ts)

**Strengths:**
- Multi-provider webhook support (Stripe, GitHub, Shopify)
- Proper timing-safe signature comparison
- Integration with correlation tracking
- Caching of authorization results

**Security Gaps:**
- Cache TTL may be too high for security-critical operations
- No IP source validation
- Missing request anomaly detection

### 4. AppSync Integration

**Strengths:**
- Custom authorizer integration provides secure webhook processing
- Type-safe integration using generated Schema types
- Proper error propagation and context passing

**Recommendations:**
- Implement field-level authorization where applicable
- Add request/response logging for audit purposes

## Infrastructure Security Recommendations

### 1. Network Security
```typescript
// Implement IP whitelist for Stripe webhooks
const STRIPE_WEBHOOK_IPS = [
  '3.18.12.63', '3.130.192.231', '13.235.14.237',
  // ... complete Stripe IP range
];

function validateSourceIP(clientIP: string): boolean {
  return STRIPE_WEBHOOK_IPS.includes(clientIP);
}
```

### 2. Rate Limiting Configuration
```yaml
# AWS API Gateway rate limiting
rate_limit:
  burst_limit: 100
  rate_limit: 10
  per: minute
  key: $request.header.x-forwarded-for
```

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
```typescript
// Security event logging
function logSecurityEvent(event: 'signature_validation_failed' | 'rate_limit_exceeded' | 'suspicious_payload', details: object) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify({
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    event_type: 'webhook_security_event',
    severity: getSeverityForEvent(event),
    event,
    details,
    correlation_id: correlationTracker.getCurrentCorrelationId()
  }));
}
```

## Conclusion

The webhook security implementation demonstrates a solid foundation with proper signature verification and deduplication mechanisms. However, critical issues including exposed secrets and merge conflicts require immediate attention. The recommended remediation plan addresses these issues in order of priority while building toward a comprehensive security posture.

**Next Review Date:** October 2, 2025
**Recommended Review Frequency:** Quarterly with immediate reviews after significant changes
